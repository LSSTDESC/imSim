# We don't use threading in imSim.  Without explicitly disabling it,
# some systems try to use implicit threading for libraries that allow
# that, and as a result, many threads can be run on a single core,
# which leads to terrible performance.  We think disabling this is
# never a problem, and sometimes extremely important.  It's best if
# this is done as soon as possible, hence we do that here, before any
# other imports.
