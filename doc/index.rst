imSim: The GalSim based Rubin Observatory image simulation package

imSim is a software package that simulates the Rubin Observatory and LSST survey. It produces simulated images from the 3.25 Gigapixel camera which are suitable to be processed through the Rubin Data Management pipeline. imSim produced the simulated exposures used in the DESC DC2 data challenge, and is the basis for the DP0 Data Set used by the wider Rubin Science community.  imSim is open source software and its development is overseen in the DESC.

This documentation covers installation, configuration, and usage instructions for the imSim program.  It also includes descriptions of several of the models implemented by imSim.
