Install
=======

.. note::
   As *imSim* is still under heave development, parts of this document
   might outdate at some point. In such cases, please submit a bug
   report :ref:`here <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/imSim/issues>`.

   The `CI directives
   <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/imSim/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml>`_
   are guaranteed to result in a working setup as they are tested very
   frequently.
  
Although *imSim* is *GalSim* based (which just can be installed via
``pip install galsim``, it also depends on the
`LSST software stack <https://pipelines.lsst.io/>`_,
which is not as easy to install.
