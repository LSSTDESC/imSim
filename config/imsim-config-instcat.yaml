# This config file configures the imSim modules with default behavior. This file
# is designed to be used as a template and some values can or should be
# overridden.
#
# At least the following value(s) should generally be overridden in order to use
# this file:
#
# input.instance_catalog.filename
#


# This tells GalSim which things to import to register extra config types
# Mostly we need the imsim repo.  But could add others here as well.
# E.g. galsim_extra has some useful routines we might want to use.  (But I don't here.)
modules:
    - imsim
    - astropy  # I don't really understand why this is required.  But if only have astropy.time
               # then I get a NameError when trying to parse astropy.time.Time.
    - astropy.time  # Need this for an Eval.  Tell GalSim to have it loaded.

# Anything set here can be used in any Eval (usually a string that starts with $) as a variable.
# This is often convenient, so they can be set just once (probably from the command line) and
# used in multiple places.
