# This imSim config file performs almost the same function as the base
# imsim-config.yaml and can be used as a template for other input configs.
# The only difference is that it overrides the image and stamp types in order
# to use the photon pooling pipeline.

# Photon pooling requires the following two changes to the base
# imsim-config.yaml, which otherwise performs the rest of the
# configuration.

# LSST_PhotonPoolingImages firstly determine how all objects are to be drawn,
# then batch the FFT and photon objects separately. FFT objects are drawn
# one-by-one first. Each photon batch contains all of the brighter photon
# objects, at 1/nbatch their total flux. Faint objects are drawn in one go after
# being randomly inserted into the photon batches at full flux. Once the photons
# from all the objects in a batch have been generated by the LSST_Photons stamp,
# the image pools and draws them.
image.type: LSST_PhotonPoolingImage

# For nbatch, we use the default of 10. Following the above, that means we have
# 10 photon pools which each contain all objects at 1/10 their flux.
# Adjusting nbatch upwards will reduce memory usage further if you need to do
# so, but it will also increase runtime due to the proportional increase in the
# number of object lookups. A very low nbatch (< 10) may impact the
# treatment of the brighter-fatter effect.
image.nbatch: 10

# Pixel boundaries on the sensor are redrawn at the start of each batch. This behaviour
# comes from nrecalc = 0 here, as well as recalc = True in LSST_PhotonPoolingImage.
image.sensor.nrecalc: 0

# LSST_Photons is a special stamp type that must be used with
# LSST_PhotonPoolingImage. FFT objects are drawn as normal. Photon shooting
# objects are however drawn with a special NullSensor which does nothing,
# leaving photon stamps to be returned with the photons only.
stamp.type: LSST_Photons

# Disable the regular GalSim truth output and instead use the photon pooling truth
# which accumulates the flux from the photon objects across all batches. (Note though
# that this measures the flux that was incident rather than the flux that was actually 
# added to the image.)
