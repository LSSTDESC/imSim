        """
        Check if the maximum surface brightness of the object is high
        enough that we should switch to using an fft method rather
        than photon shooting.

        When we do this, we also switch the PSF model to something
        slightly simpler with roughly the same wings, but not as
        complicated in the central core.  Thus, this should only be
        done when the core is going to be saturated anyway, so we only
        really care about the wings of the PSF.

        Note: This function assumes that obj at this point is a
              convolution with the PSF at the end, and that it has had
              its flux set to a new value with `withFlux()`.  If this
              is not the case, an AttributeError will be raised.

            if we decide to switch to fft drawing.
        fft_sb_thresh: float
            The surface brightness (photons/pixel) where we will switch from
